              <h2>T.I.P. President Dr. Elizabeth Quirino-Lahoz on T.I.P. Online Learning Starting Summer 2020</h2><hr>

              <p><strong>Dear T.I.P. Community,</strong></p>

              <p>First and foremost, I hope you and your family are well.</p>

              <p>We can all agree that these are challenging times and they continue to be so with the further extension by the national government of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) from May 1 to May 15, 2020.</p>

              <p>It is becoming clearer that there really is no certainty as to when our situation shall normalize; that, even if COVID-19 vaccines or cures become locally available, it shall take time for these to be administered to everyone. As such, staying at home, physical distancing, and prohibitions against mass gathering shall be the new norm for the foreseeable future, maybe even beyond.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, our personal and academic lives shall likewise remain in flux. This is tough on all of us, most especially on you, our students. But this is the reality that we are dealing with now—one wherein we need to accept change no matter how difficult it may be. We just have to be open to the new challenges before us and creatively and optimally see our way through. <strong> Learning cannot stop, and we need to use whatever tools are communally available to ensure continuity of education.</strong></p>

              <p>Many schools nationwide are currently preparing for the time when classes shall be held through various flexible learning modalities. Flexible learning is the “design and delivery of programs, courses, and learning interventions that address learners’ unique needs in terms of pace, place, process, and products of learning” (taken from Commission on Higher Education Chairman Prospero De Vera’s report to the Inter-agency Task Force [IATF] last April 27, 2020). In simpler terms, flexible learning is a holistic and inclusive manner of creating and delivering educational materials through both online and offline methods.</p>

              <p><strong>T.I.P. is stepping up to this challenge, first, with our offering of Online Summer 2020 Classes from May 11 to June 20, 2020.</strong> This aims to accommodate the portion of students who can and are willing to give purely online learning a try for this Summer term. This does not aim to discriminate against those who cannot avail themselves of such a modality. Rather, the goal here is to at least be able to serve the segment of students who are able and willing to do so. We want to be proactive as early as now because their feedback and experience shall be vital in crafting our flexible learning initiatives moving forward.</p>

              <p>We are aware that you have valid concerns about being able to actually learn online. Rest assured that the online courses we are offering for Summer 2020 have been thoroughly developed to be effective and enjoyable in the digital space. You understood that correctly! Face-to-face classes have not just been simply uploaded in a sense on your Canvas account. They were properly modified to fit this new learning environment. Of course, we shall continue to adapt materials along the way to ensure that students are still able to attain the intended learning outcomes. T.I.P. shall endeavor to be adaptive and flexible moving forward.</p>

              <p><strong><em>Despite the uncertainty of these times, T.I.P. commits itself to ensuring that our students shall be able to complete and make the most of their Summer 2020 classes.</em></strong> While purely online classes are new territory for all of us, these shall be doable because T.I.P.'s teachers shall remain dedicated throughout the student’s online learning journey. T.I.P. also commits to further strengthen i</p>
              
              <p>Again, this purely online method of delivering our Summer 2020 term will serve as the foundation for our flexible learning initiatives in the future. T.I.P. will continuously keep in touch with its stakeholders to ascertain the best and most inclusive possible means of ensuring educational continuity in the face of our current circumstances.</p>

              <p>As a community, we shall face this new challenge together, and as a community, we shall see each other through.</p>

              <p>Stay safe. Stay healthy. We shall all see each other again.</p>

              <p>
                (sgd.) <br>
